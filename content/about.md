I'm Dan.

I write code, design and build random electronic things.

I studied computer game engineering (MComp) at Newcastle University and
currently work as a scientific software engineer as part of the [Mantid
project](https://www.mantidproject.org).

In my spare time I take interest in any and all things maker/hacker related.
