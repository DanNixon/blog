I'm Dan.

I write code, design and build random electronic things.

I studied computer game engineering (MComp) at [Newcastle
University](https://www.ncl.ac.uk/) and currently work as an engineer within
the Scientific Software Group at the [Science and Technology Facilities
Council](https://stfc.ukri.org/), with a focus on data managment and treatment
software for the [European Spallation
Source](https://europeanspallationsource.se/).

In my spare time I take interest in any and all things maker/hacker related.
